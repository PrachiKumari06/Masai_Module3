framework : inbuilt thing that we are using and libraries are :
.ShadCN UI : external componenet library(ui component in 2023 it is build) : it is used by installing tailwind first then we can use it so install tailwind then in index.css,vite.config.js
.go to :https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/vite 
.then Edit tsconfig/jsconfig.json file(we create manually if not) as we work on js so jsconfig.json (tsconfig is for typescript)
.npm install -D @types/node in cmd 
.in vite.config.js :
.now in cmd:npx shadcn@latest init
.for each and every component have their installion in command(cmd) so component will create ex:npx shadcn@latest add button in cmd  then it will automatic create a component of button and now we will call in app.jsx
